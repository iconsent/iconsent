This repo contains collections of scripts that I am using with my Raspberry Pi Microk8s cluster.

Many of the examples that are available for validating different scenarios don't work on the 
arm64 platform, therefore I have written some of the examples in Java spring-boot, angular, python
and have ported some of the codes for creating container images that can be deployed on the 
microk8s platform.

Please see readme file in each of these folders to learn more about the scripts in these folders:
